# evolution-of-song-vocabularies
The project was to webscrape about 500 different lyrics from multiple artists and take preprocessing steps such as cleaning, steaming and using any of the following mentioned above to figure the evolution of song vocabularies. Used the following libraries: Scikit-learn, NLTK, Numpy, SpaCy, textblob, Matplotib, BeautifulSoup, Seaborn, Plotly, and Pandas.



#Results 
-----------------------------------
1b) The coefficient for year is .00274072 or .274% which tells us, since 1950 to 2020, each year the word
count per song has increased by .274% each year as new songs are being released by many artists.
2b) The coefficient for year is .00295444 or .295% which tells, each year the number of unique words
per song increased by .295% each year. Artists have begun to use more unique words throughout their
songs.
3b) the coefficient for year is -0.00057505 or -.0575% which tells us, each year the ratio between
number of unique words to the total of numbers decreases by .0575% per year.
Overall, this was an interesting project, I learned more about the certain libraries such as NLTK and
sklearn. This will come handy in feature projects when I want use Machine learning to see the progress
or evolution of something.
